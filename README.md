## sharpe_ratio.py
Runs a Monte Carlo simulation for N number of random portfolios composed of a list of tickers for a specified number of years.
Plots all simulated portfolios and can return the maximum sharpe ratio and the ticker weights for the portfolio which this occurs. This is the "optimal" risk-adjusted portfolio.
